    <h1>About Benjamin</h1>
    <p>
        Having a long career so far in consumer products manufacturing, I have decided to shift focus from product quality to full stack development.
        During my career, I have learned a few computer languages as well as databases and have deployed many useful applications in my workplace.
        As times have changed, it has become obvious to me that I really should refocus on my coding skills.
        To accomplish this goal, I have enrolled in a full stack bootcamp focussing on MERN variant.    I am really enjoying re-learning javascript as well as newer tech associated with that.  I have a BS ecommerce degree from University of Phoenix as well as an MBA from University of Connecticut.

        On a personal note, I am married with three daughters in college.
        My interests are Amateur Radio, 3d design/printing and of course coding..
